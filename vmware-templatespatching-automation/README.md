# Windows Template Patching Automation Script

This PowerShell script automates the patching of Windows templates hosted on vCenter. It streamlines the process of converting templates to virtual machines, applying Windows updates, and converting them back to templates. It is especially useful in lab or enterprise environments where consistent patching of Windows templates is essential.

## üìú What This Script Does

When executed, the script performs the following actions:

1. Converts a Windows template to a virtual machine (VM).
2. Assigns a DHCP VLAN network (via a specified dvPortGroup).
3. Powers on the VM and waits for it to receive an IP configuration.
4. Uses `Invoke-VMScript` to run a Windows Update script inside the VM.
5. Waits for the update process to complete and ensures all updates are applied.
6. Reboots the VM as required.
7. After updates, converts the VM back to a template.
8. Exports a status report for each processed template.
